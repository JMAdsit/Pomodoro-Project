# Pomodoro-Project
This project is made to provide an easy and quick way to do Pomodoro timers for focused work/study.
It allows for quickly adjusting the focus and break timers, so that the flow of the pomodoro work can be fitted to the activity.
It uses React useStates to render the page and manage the timer, as this allowed for a resource light page.
I may revisit this project in the future if I feel like its use case isn't flexible enough.
